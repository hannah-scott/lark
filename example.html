          I went skating at lunch and did a bunch of shit, including dropping in
          for the first time in probably 5 years. Fuck &mdash; it feels so good
          to be doing this again 🛹

          I had a very productive morning, did some house and food shopping then
          meditated. Lovely morning walking weather.
        </li>

        <li>
          I had a really nice lunch, roasted vegetables with kombucha tofu
          sausage. Have a lot of left-over veggies in the fridge now.
        </li>

        <li>
          I went for a really gorgeous autumnal walk and took some cool photos
          of my old church. Lento 10/10 camera app.

        <li>
          I went for a walk and found a little cafe that I might go to tomorrow
          morning.
        </li>

        <li>
          I did some meditation, which turned into a nap. Today was really

          Lovely evening with a lovely person, we made dinner together and

        <li>
          Did some more self-care-type tasks: body stuff, tidying. Things that

          Took the day to rest and recuperate, something I should try harder to

          I've been really getting back into running Celeste recently — got a

        </li>

        <li>
          Chatted to some friends on messaging apps for a bit. Today was a very

          I had a sinus headache today, so trying be kind to myself. Ate good

          I started learning the spike jump and double wall bounce in 4A — wow,

        I was honestly very dysphoric this morning. So I tried hard to be kind
        to myself today, and I feel like I did a good job.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          I had a delicious lunch, went for a walk, and bought some cursed
          chewing gum (raspberry and vanilla flavour).
        </li>

        <li>
          I opted for more old-school tech today: neon pink F91-W over a
          smartwatch, and my iPod for music. It did really well! Couple of minor
          memory problems but nothing a reboot couldn't fix.
        </li>

        <li>
          I went to my queer self-defense class and got a drink with them after
          — everyone is so lovely and fun.

          I got a really pleasant big day planner, which hopefully should help
          me function a bit better day-to-day.
        </li>

        <li>
          Played some more Thumper, finished level 6 which has some really tough
          sections at the end.
        </li>

        <li>
          Made some time to read after work — I've started reading The Tao of
          Pooh as part of my intermittent Le Guin-inspired Taoism reading.

          Went to the library to return some books, and got out "The Word for
          World is Forest" by Ursula K. Le Guin 📖
        </li>

        <li>
          Had a friendly and helpful chat with my mental health supporter about
          the CBT app I'll use 🧠
        </li>

        <li>
          Got the IT kit from the job I start on Monday, as well as a snazzy
          little backpack. Someone on the team reached out too!

          I watched some of the Alex Jones trial, the parents' testimony was
          deeply moving. I'm glad they get to hold him accountable.

          I feel way better today, still not 100% definitely but moving in the
          right direction 🤒
        </li>

        <li>
          Had a cathartic sob listening to She/Her/Hers, Planet of Weeds.
          Beautiful sad track about the fear and dread of losing everything
          beautiful in the world 🌳
